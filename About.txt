[PROJECT NAME]
Creating a QR Code Generator using Python

[DATE OF CREATION]
21st July 2024

[ABOUT]
Creating a QR Code Generator using Python involves using libraries like qrcode to encode data into QR codes effortlessly. Python's simplicity and robust library, can make this task straightforward. By installing qrcode via 'pip install [PACKAGE/MODULE NAME]' method, developers can generate QR codes from text, URLs, or other data types. This process typically involves importing the library, creating instances of QR code objects, setting parameters like error correction level and box size, and finally, saving the QR code image (in .png or whatever image format you would like to save). Such generators have many different uses for applications, which are ranging from digital marketing to inventory management, demonstrating Python's flexibility in modern software development.

[KEY FEATURES]
